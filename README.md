Create a sample class with actions 

**Create a sample class with actions** 

For this assignment, you should create the sample Class and sample objects with methods that you created in the written assignment. 

Your java files **MUST** be submitted with the file name : lastname_period_java0.java 
If that file is not submitted before Saturday - you will not receive credit for the assignment. 

Note: Your program must compile. 

*Please* do not submit the entire Netbeans project folder - rather go to the **src** folder for your program.
There:
git init
git remote add origin http://whatevertheurlisfromgithub
git pull origin master 

Then after you edit your files:
git add \*java
git commit -m "A super message $(date)"
git push origin master
